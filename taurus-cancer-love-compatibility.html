They will bring up a very close family where members genuinely love and care for each other. Many couples will envy their family setup. The family is very tight and they give more priority to family matters than other matters.</p><p>This Taurus and Cancer marriage has one problem. When the Taurus comes up with ideas that Cancer does not like, they will often have a very <a href=#>bad mood</a>. For this reason, Taurus is advised to tolerate the Cancerian’s needy nature. Cancer on the other hand is supposed to be direct and talk out his/her issues to find a solution. Cancer should also refrain from manipulative behavior to keep the relationship perfect.</p><p>Taurus and Cancer love compatibility is the most compatible of the Zodiac. They both want a home. A home that has a family and loving friends. They want to settle and be where they should be for the rest of their lives. These two get married soon after they meet.

Just as the moon controls the earth silently so does Cancer manipulate his way through issues of the relationship. Cancer comes off as affectionate. Both of them love to spend time together instead of mingling with people.</p><p>Cancer is cardinal in terms of signs while Taurus is Fixed. Taurus is very assertive and will not change his/her mind on anything he/she decides. When Cancer comes up with ideas, Taurus sees them through to the end thus these two complement each other. This concept makes these two have a long-lasting relationship. Taurus is always all in when he decides that Cancer is the one. Cancer then sees him/her as the rock in the relationship. Cancer finds a place to hide during bad times, and this place is Taurus.</p><p>Lovemaking between the Taurus and Cancer in bed will be as much fun and passionate as you could imagine. All you need to do is learn new methods to make it interesting.</p><h3>Taurus Cancer Compatibility – Negative</h3><p>Taurus is controlled by the Planet Venus which stands for love and affection and Cancer is controlled by the moon which is emotion and feelings. Both are filled with feminine vigor. Cancer is less direct and will keep opinions and bad feelings to himself/herself. This does blow over from time to time and that is when things get ugly in the Taurus and Cancer compatibility.</p><p>Taurus signifies Earth and Cancer signifies Water. It is obvious that water takes care of the earth thus it is expected that Taurus nurtures Cancer. The main job of Taurus is to help Cancer through his/her emotional issues as she/he is prone to <a href=#>emotional breakdowns</a>. The problem comes when Taurus has had enough of all the emotional drama from the Crab. He/she will pull away and not be as supportive and this may end the relationship. The couple is advised to understand one another and not to overwhelm each other.</p><p>Taurus is very stubborn. This is very bad for the Taurus Cancer love compatibility. Cancer may pose a suggestion and Taurus will put him/her down with less thought. This does not go well with Cancer who dreads dismissal. Taurus should learn to be more flexible and willing to change a formally created opinion on a certain issue. Cancer needs to understand Taurus nature and embrace it to save the relationship.</p><h4>Taurus And Cancer Compatibility – Conclusion</h4><p>A Taurus Cancer relationship is bound to be successful. These two do the best they can. They are the best at what they do and they will not get their eyes off the corner office. They love their life of high level respect and admiration from people and they will do all it takes to maintain it. Taurus is the spendthrift person in this relationship. He/she will get a sports car just to fulfill a childhood fantasy.</p><p>Cancer will use all leftover shampoo just to avoid wastage. This can be a sign of alarm. Cancer may form a certain kind of resentment towards Taurus for <a href=#>spending money</a> that has been hard-earned so recklessly. If Taurus slows down on the spending and Cancer lets loose a little, then this will be solved.</p><p>Have you found the one? You will enjoy this Taurus Cancer compatibility. Be very patient on the fast days. Do not maneuver your way into your partner’s life. Wait for them to invite you in when they are ready for you. Let the relationship flow without causing unnecessary chaos or tags of war.</p><p>The Taurus and Cancer love compatibility will be on for a long time as long as both stars keep it real and lovely.
