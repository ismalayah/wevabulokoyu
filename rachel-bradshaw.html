The cause of his death was blunt force trauma caused by the car crash. At that time, his blood-alcohol level was <i>0.218%</i>, and he lost control of his <i>2009 </i>Yukon Denali and crashed.</p><p>Before the incident happened, <a href=# rel=nofollow>Bironas left the house at 10:30 pm</a>, saying her Goodnight, and she assumed that he was going to bed. However, she didn't find him on the couch and started searching and calling relatives.

Shortly after the call, he was found dead in the car crash.</p><h2>Wedding Ring As A Necklace</h2><p>Being a widow in a short period is very tragic and heartbreaking. Rachel has gone through the same unfortunate incident when she lost her partner, Rob Bironas, after marrying him for three months.

He was a warrior and forever will be."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/1/28/download-1580206504386.jpg><p>Not only that, but she has also made her wedding ring a unique symbol of love by turning it into a necklace and wearing it.
