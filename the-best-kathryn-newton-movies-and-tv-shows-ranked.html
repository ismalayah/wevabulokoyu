The film mainly follows the life of Elizabeth Halsey, played by Cameron Diaz, as a poor Chicago-area teacher who seems to despise everything: her job, her students, and her co-workers. She’s stuck in the teaching job because she got dumped by her wealthy fiancé and she needs money for breast implants. Things would, however, take a turn when a cute and rich substitute teacher named Scott Delacorte arrives in the school. Newton here stars as Chase Rubin-Rossi, a popular schoolgirl who’s the object of attraction for many, especially a fellow student named Garret Tiara.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>7. </strong><strong>The Society</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=645 data-current-count=945 data-injectable=true>This Netflix original, which was created by Christopher Keyser, was one of the better shows in the year of its release.
